      <div class="text2">
        <h4>
          A blockchain is “a distributed database that maintains a continuously
          growing list of ordered records, called blocks.” These blocks “are
          linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of
          the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.

      <h1 class="title">What are blockchain games</h1>
      <div class="text3">
        <h4>
          Video games that include elements that use blockchain technologies,
          including cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), allow
          players to buy, sell, or trade in-game items with other players. The
          game publisher takes a fee from each transaction as a form of
          monetization. A subset of these games are also known as play-to-earn
          games because they include systems that allow players to earn
          cryptocurrency through gameplay. Blockchain games have existed since
          2017, gaining more widespread attention from the video game industry
          in 2021. Several AAA publishers have expressed intent to include this
          technology in the future. Players, developers, and game companies have
          criticized the use of blockchain technology in video games for being
          exploitative, environmentally unsustainable, and unnecessary.

        <h4>
          Blockchain technology, such as cryptocurrencies and NFTs, provides
          potential monetization routes for video games. Many live-service games
          offer in-game customization options, such as character skins or other
          in-game items, which the players can earn and trade with other players
          using in-game currency. Some games also allow for trading of virtual
          items using real-world currency, but this may be illegal in some
          countries where video games are seen as akin to gambling. This has led
          to gray market issues such as skin gambling, and so publishers
          typically have shied away from allowing players to earn real-world
          funds from games.Blockchain games typically allow players to trade
          in-game items for cryptocurrency, which can then be exchanged for
          money, which may sidestep some problems associated with gray markets
          due to blockchain's traceability.
